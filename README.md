# Weather-App

This Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather for a specific city. It provides real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon.

Skills Utilized
This project showcases the following skills:

Front-End Development: The web interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user experience.

Asynchronous JavaScript: Asynchronous programming is used to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and update the UI dynamically without refreshing the page.

API Integration: The application integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for the specified city.

Features
Search by City: Users can enter the name of a city in the provided input field and click the search button to fetch weather information for that city.

Error Handling: The app handles errors gracefully. If a city is not found or the API request fails, an error message is displayed to the user.

Dynamic Weather Icon: Based on the weather conditions (e.g., clear sky, clouds, rain), the app displays an appropriate weather icon.

API Used
This project makes use of the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain weather data. The API provides information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for a given location.

API Endpoint: OpenWeatherMap API
Purpose
